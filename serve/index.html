<h2>&ndash; Syria</h2>

<h2>While reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Syrian-Rebellion-Fouad-Ajami/dp/0817915044">Fouad Ajami&rsquo;s great book</a> about the Syrian uprising, I stumbled on a part about the brave city of Homs.</h2>

<p>If Hama lent its name—and trauma—to the events of the 1980s, this would be the era of Homs. This city had a high idea of itself as a pious and serious town and the burial place of Khalid bin al-Walid, the conqueror who had defeated the Byzantine Empire. It had supplied the country with three of its presidents and countless members of the political class—cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and more. It was in Homs and the towns in its orbit that the doubts about the efficacy of peaceful protest had crystallized. An expat from Homs, in a posting for Syria Comment on October 18, 2011, rightly dubbed Homs “the capital of the uprising.” The writer, unnamed, provides a brief sketch of the city, its demography, and the changes that it underwent in recent years. It had been an overwhelmingly Sunni city, with a prosperous Christian minority that was approximately 10 percent of the population. An Ottoman census in 1903 listed a population of 51,000 people. (Homs now had 1.5 million inhabitants.) Like other towns in Greater Syria, Homs was led by notables, a cohesive group of merchant and religious families. A handful of these families owned most of the fertile land. The sweeping changes that remade Syria as a whole—the recruitment of the minorities into the armed forces, the rise of an ideologically driven younger generation through the Baath Party and the military—battered Homs and its old order. The notables were undermined, the city’s demography altered. People from the countryside made their presence felt. The geography of the city responded to this influx, Christian newcomers occupied large parts of the Old City, and the Sunnis settled west, north, and east of the Old City walls. The Alawis were now a quarter of the population, huddled together in the southeastern quarter.</p>

<p>There was nothing unusual about this separation of the communities. All Ottoman cities were divided along confessional and religious lines. Homs turned inward in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the defeat of its twin city, Hama, shook the self-confidence of the Sunnis of Homs as well. The Alawis were the regime’s people and did not integrate well, this retrospect tells us. They were favored with government patronage, and they manned the mukhabarat and the security forces. Things were not idyllic in Homs, but the communities had managed a tolerable coexistence. An American diplomatic cable from 2010 drew on the testimonies of Melkite Catholic Archbishop Isidore Battikha and Greek Patriarchate Deputy Patriarch Father Afram. Their communities were thriving, the two religious leaders said. Their churches “enjoyed excellent relationships with their Muslim counterparts.” Archbishop Battikha had served for fifteen years in Damascus prior to being transferred to the Homs diocese. It was better in Homs, he said, between the Muslims and the Christians, because the two populations lived “closer together.” The archbishop was asked two or three times a year to speak in mosques, and it was his practice to invite imams to give speeches in his churches. The two groups did not pray together. Christianity was not endangered here. There were 45,000 Catholics in his diocese, second in size only to Damascus, and Father Afram said his Greek Orthodox church had stabilized at 150,000 after years of out-migration.</p>

<p>The peace of the city was punctured by this rebellion. This played out in a pattern familiar to those who followed the Lebanon war in the 1970s and 1980s and the ordeal of Sarajevo in the early 1990s. The neighborhoods of Homs split along sectarian fault lines—the Alawis and the Sunnis were at war with each other. (The Christians were not exactly equidistant between the two communities. They were allies of the Alawis and by and large committed to the regime.) The Sunnis had been moved not so much by Salafi extremism, we are told, but by the resentments over unequal access to economic opportunity and state patronage. On the face of it, this kind of proposition could be given credence. But the resentments were long in the making. The Sunnis from Homs had been waiting for deliverance—and retribution.</p>

<p>The town of Rastan, in Homs’s orbit, had all but fallen to the rebellion by the closing days of August, and army defectors had made a stand there aided by the local population. A group of defectors went by a storied and meaningful name, the Khalid bin al-Walid Battalion. The name played on the de-legitimization of the Alawi regime as a reign of heretics and outsiders. Rastan lay on the main road to Aleppo, and Homs had grown increasingly defiant with its checkered neighborhoods at war with one another. The rebels had begun to target local figures of the regime and its known sympathizers. In response, the shabiha had gone on a rampage. The regime had to retrieve Rastan lest it emerge as a liberated city—and the base for a more determined insurgency. The regime’s attack came in late September. Security forces backed by tanks and helicopters were dispatched to Rastan. The battle for the town had taken four days. The defectors had pulled out and their battalion had withdrawn to spare the town further killings, they announced. The security forces and the shabiha, the local vigilantes, commandeered hospitals and clinics and converted schools into detention centers. “Big losses,” the regime’s media routinely announced, were inflicted on the “armed terrorist groups.”</p>

<p>The rebels had not prevailed, but the regime was nowhere close to being done with the upheaval. A tipping point may have been reached in Rastan and Homs, and the opposition was edging closer to turning into an armed insurrection. The conflict was becoming “weaponized,” and arms were making their way into Homs and smuggled across Syria’s porous borders. Elements of the regime were themselves selling weapons on the black market. Amid the violence, the people of Homs had grown braver still, taunting the dictator and prophesying his fall. It was as though Homs was taking pride in showing up Damascus and Aleppo and outdoing Hama. A measure of guilt played upon Syria’s Sunni majority in that they had given in to the regime, that they had been cowed in the face of official terror, and that they had paid dearly for their old aversion to military service, the culture of guns, and martial ways. Now Homs was making up for all that, and the caution had been thrown overboard. The self-styled heirs of Khalid bin al-Walid were through with submission to a godless lot.</p>

<p>(Amid Homs’s pain, a story broke in early October. Steve Jobs, the man who mastered our technological age, was the biological son of a man from Homs. Abdul Fattah “John” Jandali hailed from a Homs family of means. He had made his way to America in the early 1950s by way of the American University of Beirut. He had obtained a doctorate in political science from the University of Wisconsin. He had fathered a child out of wedlock and gave him up for adoption. This was the future Steve Jobs, who had grown up in the Bay Area. But in the manner of a people eager to see evidence of their success wherever it could be found, Jobs was now a “grandson of Homs.” The Arabic electronic daily Elaph was flooded with Homsis and others straining for a connection to the wizard. “If you want another Steve Jobs, stop the killing of Syrian children,” one posting to Elaph had it. Had Jobs been in Homs, an unsentimental posting read, he would have been protesting in the streets, or his father who would have been looking for him in the morgue or prison, as many parents in Homs had had to do.)</p>

<p>The regime was all in by now: its way was that of unrelenting violence. Bashar had no olive branches to offer. He had spoken three times to his country in the first phase of this conflict, and then he opted for silence. The protests were edging close to the capital. By October there were demonstrations near Bashar’s presidential palace. The thinking of the man was conveyed through “guests” and interlocutors from Lebanon who had been summoned to Damascus for meetings with him. Two Sunni public figures, former Prime Ministers Salim al-Hoss from Beirut and Omar Karame from Tripoli, were put to cynical use. They came out of Bashar’s bunker to say that the ruler was at ease with the condition of his country, that Syria had gone beyond the danger point and had put the events behind it, and that the “reforms” the president had in mind would see Syria to safe harbor. (Omar Karame was a man of little substance. Salim al-Hoss, in contrast, was a liberal figure of genuine standing, and his trip to Damascus was at variance with his record in public life.)</p>

<p>It was important for this embattled regime to convey a sense of mastery. A report went out that Bashar had told the Turkish foreign minister that he was capable of shattering the peace of the region in “no more than six hours.” He would fire rockets across the Golan Heights into Israel, and he would call upon Hezbollah to launch its rockets into Tel Aviv. And further out, even the peace of the Persian Gulf would be shattered if Syria was cornered and subjected to a foreign invasion. Syria was not Libya, the ruler had said. (This was a variation on the theme of Syria’s uniqueness, at the beginning of the Arab Spring, that Syria was not Tunisia or Egypt and was thus immune to popular upheaval.)</p>

<p>A break came the regime’s way in early October courtesy of the United Nations Security Council. A toothless resolution had been brought to the Security Council containing a weak reference to the possibility of economic sanctions against Damascus. The resolution had the backing of the liberal democracies—the United States, Britain, and France. If the protesters in Syria needed illumination about the cruel ways of the world, the deliberations at the Security Council provided it. The resolution met with the double veto of Russia and China. The two big autocracies are invested in tyranny, and their vote was no surprise. On the narrowest of grounds, the Chinese had Tibet in mind and the Russians were thinking of the Chechens. Tyranny is indivisible, and popular protest is a menace to all these two autocracies embody and hold dear. (Russia has a naval base in the Syrian coastal city of Tartus, as the call of empire had not died out in Russia.)</p>

<p>In a note of supreme irony, Russia and China had used the conduct of NATO in Libya as a pretext for resisting any green light for the Western powers over the Syrian standoff. NATO, it is fair to say, had taken a Security Council resolution that authorized the protection of Libyan civilians and ran with it. The protection of Libyan civilians had turned into a warrant for unseating the Qaddafi regime. China and Russia would draw a line when it came to Syria.</p>

<p>The sordid vote at the Security Council over Syria was an indictment of the three “emerging” powers that abstained on so simple a proposition—India, Brazil, and South Africa. If these powers were making a bid for a more prominent role in the world, if their conduct was a bid for a permanent role on the Security Council, their moral abdication was proof that they were not ready to shoulder the burden of maintaining a decent international order. The shame of India, the world’s largest democracy, was all its own. India is forever thinking of Kashmir, and the principle of unfettered national sovereignty must be maintained at all cost. There was not much to say about Brazil and South Africa. Their exalted view of themselves is preening and illusion. Brazil was said to have bought the Syrian regime’s claim that its survival was a shield for the Christians. South Africa came into this affair with a dishonorable performance in the Libyan saga behind it. The tyranny of Muammar el-Qaddafi never troubled Pretoria, and the “king of kings of Africa” had squandered plenty of his people’s treasure buying off the consent and approval of so many African states.</p>

<p>Judging by its conduct in the immediate aftermath of the Security Council resolution, the regime took that vote as a green light for a heavier dosage of repression still. On October 7 a noted Kurdish leader in the opposition, Mashaal Tammo, was assassinated in his hometown of Qamishli in the northeast. Tammo, who headed a small Kurdish party, had served a three-year prison sentence for his activism. In the spectrum of Kurdish sentiments, Tammo was an assimilationist. His party sought the integration of the Kurds into mainstream national political life. He was a member of the newly formed Syrian National Council. The Kurds, no less than 10 percent of the Syrian population, had been wary of the protests. They had worried about the national chauvinism of the Arabs, and they were not happy with the influence that Turkey had come to exercise over the Syrian rebellion. Qamishli, the principal Kurdish city in the country, had known sporadic protests, and all had been small in size. Now with this crime, the regime had pushed the Kurds into the opposition. A crowd of no fewer than 50,000 people poured into the streets of Qamishli—in defiance of the government. The security forces fired into the funeral procession, and two mourners were killed. The regime was busy making its own enemies. True to form, the official media said a black car with four armed men fired at Tammo, killing him and wounding his son.</p>

<p>Goons and bullies do what they do. The regime had given its vigilantes a license to frighten off noted figures of the opposition. The political cartoonist Ali Ferzat, arguably the most famous and accomplished in his craft in the Arab world, was given a savage beating. His hands were broken, and he was left bleeding by the side of the road on the way to the Damascus airport. Before the attack on him, his most recent cartoon depicted Qaddafi in his jeep picking up Bashar al-Assad, who was hitching a ride. In Homs, the aged parents of a distinguished pianist, Malek Jandali, were assaulted in their home. Their son had taken part in an anti-regime event in the United States, and the parents, an old physician and an equally accomplished spouse, were to be punished for the sins of their son. Riad Seif, a former parliamentarian and an activist who had done his own stint in the regime’s prisons, was beaten in broad daylight as he left a centrally located mosque in the heart of Damascus. Riad Seif was not in the best of health. He had been battling cancer, and this humiliation and violence by the security forces was not going to deter him. His membership in the Syrian National Council was public, and because he was inside the country while so many oppositionists were abroad, he was within reach. Yet another critic of the regime, former parliamentarian Mamoun al-Homsi, was punished; his son was picked up and taken away by the security forces. The Syrian rulers were now out to show that they were beyond censure or limits.</p>

<p>This display of open contempt for the exhortations and condemnations leveled at the regime masked a nervousness on the part of the rulers. For all this petty bravado, Syria was not Russia or China; it was not even Iran, its regional ally and protector. Bashar and the ruling cabal around him lacked the wealth and the weight needed to sustain a tyranny that runs afoul of the norms of decent conduct. There was no wealth to cushion the dictatorship; oil exports provided the regime with a third of its income, and now these exports were subjected to effective sanctions. Bashar, like his father before him, had secured the support of the business classes and the merchants in Damascus and Aleppo with a political economy of favoritism and bureaucratic preferences—crony capitalism in its purest form. Now the beneficiaries of this regime had begun to worry whether the edifice will stand. There were reports that the monied classes—big Sunni and Christian interests—had begun to hedge their bet and invest in the rebellion. The confidence of the ruling cabal had cracked. On September 22, a decision was made to suspend imports of goods that have over 5 percent customs duties—effectively most of the country’s imports that matter. The economy was brought to a standstill, and the business class that had averted its gaze from the repression came out in full against this ban. Twelve days later, the government gave in. Gone was the bravado that the ban on imports would help Syria overcome the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Thus the pressure was on to be done with the rebellion, to subdue the population before economic collapse set in. Even the dreaded shabiha, the regime’s vigilantes doing its killings and barbarisms, had to be paid. Their excesses mounted as they were unleashed on ordinary Syrians to extort from them what the regime itself could no longer provide.</p>

<p>The bluff of the Syrian rulers was being called; Russia had given cover to the regime at the United Nations Security Council, but days later, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev let it be known that there were limits to Russia’s indulgence. Syria was in need of reforms, Medvedev observed, and “if the Syrian leadership is incapable of conducting such reforms, it will have to go. But this decision would be taken not in NATO or certain European countries. It should be taken by the Syrian people and the Syrian leadership.”</p>

<p>THIS REGIME had risen out of the military. It had enlisted security and paramilitary forces from outside the army. For decades, the nation’s army had been honored and praised. It stood to reason that the protesters would hope that the army would break ranks and that defections would seal its fate. In that spirit Friday, October 14, was named the Friday of the Free Army—seven full months after the eruption of the rebellion. The killing machine was relentless, and 21 people were struck down on that day. To be sure, there had been defections. Bands of soldiers and their officers, doubtless Sunnis, had broken ranks. There were videos of them flashing their army identity cards and speaking in earnest of the reasons for their defection. There had been clashes between the defectors and the regime’s forces. But the mutiny hoped for by the protesters had not materialized. The Assad regime may not have mastered the skills of developing a decent, prosperous society. But it had to be granted the men of the regime that they knew how to put together a formidable system of repression. They could rely of course on the loyalty of the Alawis, but it wasn’t just sectarian loyalty that held the regime together. There was ruthlessness aplenty and skill in the way the military units were deployed.</p>

<p>A sense of this system in place was given Agence France-Presse by defectors who had made their way to Lebanon. It was kill or be killed in the ranks of the army. A 25-year-old lieutenant from the central province of Homs supplied details of the workings of the army. Four months earlier, he had been off duty, in his village, when the army raided the place. He could not bear what he had witnessed. Soldiers had burst into the home of a suspected activist. They had shot the man’s wife and daughters in the legs to force them to reveal the man’s whereabouts. A 20-year-old soldier, also from Homs, said his unit was often told to shoot at innocent bystanders. “I saw with my own eyes an unarmed older farmer in a village in Homs province go by on a bicycle, and we were ordered to shoot him in the back.” An efficient political army had been put together—Sunni recruits, Alawi commanders, and battalions from different brigades thrown together. These soldiers didn’t know each other and had no history of familiarity and comradeship. The soldiers were never in doubt that they themselves would be struck down if they didn’t follow their orders. From the young lieutenant again: “I got out because I need to live with a clear conscience. I joined the army to protect my people and my land, to free the Golan, not Homs and Deraa.”</p>

<p>The military units were given orders to “kill or kill”—kill the protesters or kill those soldiers who refuse to obey orders. Soldiers were banned from using cell phones, they could watch only state television, and they were given a steady diet of lectures about the goodness of the Assad family and the benevolence of the leader. The soldiers were deployed up front, the mukhabarat operatives behind them. Snipers on rooftops would fire at soldiers pointed out to them by the officers and the mukhabarat. Soldiers who wanted out of the killing and stopped firing could be summarily executed on the spot. The military uniform offered no protection. The regime and its intelligence agencies had prepared for this moment.</p>

<p>Ahmad, from Aleppo, posted a short message on Al Jazeera on October 20, on learning of the killing of Qaddafi: Mabrook (congratulations), he said to the people of Libya, may the same thing happen here in Syria. That case of “Libya envy” was on display, Libyans had gotten rid of their tyrant, and the Syrians were still in the thick of their fight, the eighth month of their war against the regime had just opened. The rulers were still insisting on the “specialness” of Syria, on its immunity to the fate that had befallen the reigns of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, Mubarak in Egypt, and Qaddafi in Libya. Abandoned by their armed forces, the Tunisian and Egyptian strongmen had packed it in. Bashar and the ruling cabal had no intention of giving in. The crack units defending the regime were invested in it, and their very safety derived from the regime’s survival. As for the Libyan case, the Syrian rulers were confident that it held no relevance for them. Indeed, in a note of cruel irony, the deliverance of Libya was used by the Russians and the Chinese as a case of a NATO operation that overreached, that took a yellow light at the United Nations Security Council as a warrant for overthrowing the Libyan dictator. For the Russians and the Chinese, there would be no more interventions of the Libyan variety. For its part, the Syrian regime told its own people, and Arabs beyond, that its place in the Arab constellation of power dwarfed that of the erratic Libyan ruler. Syria took pride in being a founding member of the Arab League, with her rights and prerogatives in that body way beyond those claimed by Qaddafi.</p>

<p>There was no likelihood that the Arab League, which had authorized a NATO operation in the name of defending the civilian population of Libya, would do the same in the Syrian case. And truth be known, the Arab League had not proven the Damascus regime wrong. In October, Syria was given a reprieve of fifteen days for the regime to bring an end to the violence against the protests. The rebellion had always been rich in iconography, with poignant messages on placards held up to the cameras. One such placard from Homs now noted that the Syrian people were being massacred “with the permission of the Arab League.” Nabil El-Araby, the secretary-general of the Arab League and an honest international jurist, conceded the weakness of his organization. He had no forces at his disposal. Only the United Nations Security Council had the power to compel member states to alter their ways. Stoicism had settled upon the protesters. One telling proclamation held up to the camera simply read, “With us is God,” Maana Allah. The fight between the irresistible force and the immovable object had not been settled. Bashar and the “killing machine” around him were doing their best to break the will of the population, to tell them that they are alone in the world and that the state possessed formidable means of repression at home and diplomatic assets abroad. There were oppositionists who fled the regime’s wrath to Lebanon, and they were particularly vulnerable. They had crossed the border into a Syrian protectorate, and the regime could reach into Lebanon directly, kidnap its opponents, liquidate them at will, and have its way through its pliable Lebanese surrogates. There were friends of Syria’s liberty in Lebanon, public figures and intellectuals, who understood the linkage between Syria’s liberty and their own. But the Syrian eruption had happened when a Hezbollah-led government in Beirut was allied with the Damascus regime. “There is no safety in Lebanon,” a man from the border town of Tell Kalakh said from his refuge in Wadi Khaled, in Lebanon’s northernmost corner, a valley that juts into Syria. “The government in Lebanon is allied to the Syrian regime, and that is not a secret.”</p>

<p>The servile cabinet of Prime Minister Najib Mikati promised protection for the Syrian refugees—there were about 3,000 of them—but no credence would be given that promise. The Lebanese rulers had not protected their own against Syrian cruelty, and they would not risk the wrath of Damascus on behalf of Syrians fleeing the fire. No Syrian opponent of the regime was safe in Lebanon. The terror took in the prominent and the humble alike. A laborer distributing leaflets against the regime was picked up, along with two of his brothers, and the three of them were spirited off to Syria. The authorities in Beirut suspected that a Lebanese security officer had been an accomplice in the kidnapping. And there was a more noted case of abduction. In late May, 89-year-old Shibli al-Aismay, one of the early leaders of the Baath who had lost out in the party’s fratricidal wars, went out for his daily walk in a once-tranquil town in Mount Lebanon and never returned. Aismay had come to Lebanon from the United States, where he had been living, to visit his daughter and perhaps to oversee the publication of his memoirs. The man, a Druze, had had no political role since 1966, when Michel Aflaq and the “founding fathers” of the party were overthrown by a younger generation of officers. But the regime had taken no chances, and Lebanese security officers uncovered the evidence of a kidnapping tied to the Syrian Embassy in Beirut.</p>

<p>Courage had not deserted the Lebanese. Nayla Tueni, the publisher of An-Nahar and now a bearer of her father’s torch, wrote a scathing column on October 31 titled, “Don’t Turn Lebanon into a Syrian Prison.” “Lebanon was once a refuge for all the oppressed in the Arab world, particularly for those who sought freedom of opinion and belonging. It is being turned into a prison and an instrument of Syrian repression, a regime that practiced all sorts of tyranny and torture against the Lebanese before it turned its wrath against its own people.”</p>

<p>The terms of engagement in Syria had not altered; it was a race for time between the regime and the protesters. The rulers knew the economics of their tyranny. They were running down their financial reserves. The sanctions imposed on the sale of oil had worked, and the patience of the merchant class in Aleppo and Damascus and the indulgence they had granted the regime had their limits. On the other side, the multitudes risking all in their attempt to topple the regime were up against the limits of endurance. People can’t indefinitely live on their nerves, go out day after day, and face heavily armed forces of order and vigilantes. Privation is always a factor in these great contests of will—the shortages of food and medicine, and the burden of securing daily necessities. The rhythm of normal life had been shattered. Schooling for the young had been interrupted. “Today a school, tomorrow a detention center,” the placard of one schoolboy read during this time. There was no meaning for schooling without liberty, defiant schoolchildren proclaimed. The regime wasn’t stepping aside, and the protesters were not calling off their rebellion.</p>

<p>A YOUNG BOY of 15 or 16 in stylish sunglasses holds up a sign reading, “If I weren’t Syrian I would want to be Libyan.” This was late October, and this boy and others taking to the streets had witnessed the killing of the Libyan dictator. This had given them heart. They could see in the punishment of Qaddafi a prelude of what they wanted for their own dictator. Authority was being stripped of its magic: Saddam Hussein had been flushed out of his spider hole in 2003, Hosni Mubarak had been turning up at court on a gurney, and now Qaddafi had been dragged out of a drainage pipe. Friday, October 28, was named the Friday for the No-Fly Zone. The reticence about foreign help was giving way, and pride was yielding to necessity. Samir Nashar, a noted member of the umbrella opposition group, the Syrian National Council, gave a forthright assessment of the standoff with the regime. Foreign intervention and civil war were terrible options, he said, and most Syrians rejected these alternatives, but the worst possible outcome was the survival of the regime. “That last possibility had no definite shelf life for Bashar inherited power from his father and could yet bequeath it to his son. We don’t live in the colonial age. Here before us is the Libyan precedent. Had it not been for military intervention, Qaddafi would have exterminated the people of Benghazi.”</p>

<p>The cruelty of the regime was making a mockery of the “red lines” of the opposition and the pieties of nationalism. Homs was now a city under siege, short of bread, water, and provisions. Shops whose owners supported the regime were selling things at a premium, and those whose owners supported the protests had been subjected to theft or arson. That Friday was particularly grim: the cities of Homs and Hama had been targeted, 40 people were killed, and hundreds were rounded up. This was the bloodiest day in over five months. Vigilantes on motorbikes were randomly shooting people in Homs. An old district of the city—a Sunni neighborhood—was shelled. The regime understood the import of this day. Sure enough, no NATO planes were on the runways on their way toward Syria, but the rulers couldn’t be fully certain that the outside world could withstand indefinite carnage in Syria. A hawkish United States senator, John McCain, who had played no small part in the debate over Libya, had begun to make the case for intervention in Syria. A regime given to a healthy dosage of paranoia could not be certain about the play in the Western democracies. Sure enough, the regime in Damascus had taken the measure of the Arab League. On October 16, the Arab League in a Cairo meeting had ruled out foreign intervention and trade sanctions, and had even refused to suspend Syria’s membership in the League. But NATO and the Turkish state next door could not be taken for granted.</p>

<p>The change in Turkey’s attitude was a source of worry. The Turks were now giving shelter and asylum to Syrian army defectors. A no-fly zone and a protected area on the border that could serve as a magnet for army defectors and insurgents had to be duly considered. The script had not varied. The regime’s assaults were the policy of rulers in a hurry to prevail. Time and again, the protests and their size and intensity confounded the regime’s expectations that it had ridden out the worst of it. For its part, the regime had long obliterated the “red lines” that rulers observe if the most rudimentary form of social contract is to be maintained. Mosques had long ceased to be inviolable and off-limits, and violence was now visited on hospitals and clinics. Amnesty International, in a report issued on October 25, documented a pattern of systematic abuse and cruelty. Security forces had been given the run of hospitals, and the medical staff were taking part in the torture and ill treatment of their patients. National hospitals in Baniyas, Homs, and Tell Kalakh had been particularly egregious. As blood supplies could be obtained only from the Central Blood Bank—controlled by the Ministry of Defense—doctors were faced with a terrible dilemma. The requests for blood entailed putting the patients at risk of arrest, torture, or possibly death in custody. There is a social capital born of modernity and often acquired in the face of difficult odds, and this health care system was part of it—physicians, nurses, and other caregivers brought up to some decent professional norms. Now this heritage was of the past, the regime destroying this last vestige of a secure public order. Patients were awakening from traumas to nurses in white robes armed with clubs and rifles. Hospital workers and physicians suspected of sympathizing with the wounded were savagely beaten by the security forces.</p>

<p>The opposition was not chastened, but its leaders conceded that the regime had the advantage in the weekend that followed the Friday for the No-Fly Zone. At least 60 people were reported killed, and Homs had come in for another dose of violence. No deliverance was within sight, and Bashar al-Assad put on a brave face. He fell back yet again on the standing of Syria in a sensitive and volatile region in an interview he gave to The Sunday Telegraph on October 30: “Syria is the hub now in this region. It is the fault line and if you play with the ground you will cause an earthquake—do you want to see another Afghanistan, or tens of Afghanistans? Any problem in Syria will burn the whole region.” His regime, he said, made some early mistakes. It had not been ready for the eruption, but things had improved and the security forces now targeted only terrorists. Diplomacy was moribund, the (mild) threats of the Arab League were hollow, and a mediation effort sponsored by the League had called upon “both sides” to stop the violence, which could only have fortified Assad’s will. The Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani, who had played a pivotal role in the struggle that overthrew the Qaddafi regime, warned that the entire region was “at risk of a massive storm.” The League urged Syria to withdraw its tanks from the streets, but this was to no avail.</p>

<p>The regime’s assets were not yet spent. There was the Free Syrian Army of the defectors, but they were no match for the security forces. Their leader, a colonel, spoke from Turkey. He appeared, it was learned, in a suit given him by his Turkish handlers. Turkey had effectively turned on Bashar, but it had not set out to topple him. NATO representatives and leaders were running a victory lap for their performance over Libya—they had declared the completed mission a brilliant success—but the gift given Libya was not there for the Syrians. Arab pilots and aircraft from Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan had taken part in the Libyan campaign. Qatar had been particularly assertive and had even sent special forces to Libya. But the Syrian oppositionists were on their own.</p>

<p>Washington had not taken up the cause of this rebellion. President Obama, the standard-bearer of American power, had gone half-in into the Libyan endeavor. Syria was a bridge too far. President Obama had his eye on his bid for a second term. He would be taking into that bid the proud claim that he fulfilled a promise by ending the war in Iraq; he would not saddle himself with another conflict in the Fertile Crescent. There had been these early hopes invested in Bashar, which the diplomatic cables from Damascus had confirmed. Early on, there was the cautious reading of the balance of forces between the regime and the opposition. The American position would undergo a slow, painful change, which was no great comfort to the rebellion. On April 22, the White House had called on Assad to “change course now and heed the calls of his own people.” “Meaningful reforms” were overdue, but the rulers had “placed their personal interests ahead of the Syrian people.” On July 11 came a stronger statement, this time from the secretary of state: “President Assad is not indispensible, and we have absolutely nothing invested in him remaining in power. If anyone, including President Assad, thinks that the United States is secretly hoping that the regime will emerge from this turmoil to continue its brutality and repression, they are wrong.” On August 12, the secretary of state gave away the ambivalence in American policy. By now, the repression was five months and counting: “There are Syrian opposition figures outside of Syria and inside. But there’s no address for the opposition. There is no place any of us who wish to assist can go.” There were “multiple return addresses” by then—in Deraa, Hama, Baniyas, and Jisr al-Shughour—but the American statements were an honest reflection of an unwillingness to take the lead on Syrian matters. It would be in a statement, on August 18, that President Obama would finally call on the Syrian ruler to step aside. “We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way. He has not led. For the sake of the Syrian people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.”</p>

<p>The reluctance to make that call on Assad to leave office was understandable. The critics clamor for such a call, and they were doing so in this Syrian case. This statement made and the noncoercive options spent, it is now either anticlimactic or a resort to arms. President Obama had been clear in every way that there was no interest in unseating the Assad regime by force of arms. In a perfect world, these Syrian protesters would be given the rarest of gifts. The Americans would unseat this despot—and then locate him somewhere in a spider hole or a drainage pipe—without the Syrian oppositionists openly asking for military help. But the world, we know, does not grant such wishes.</p>

<p>For well over four months, Bashar al-Assad had stayed out of the limelight, the foreign media effectively kept out of Syria. But by late October, he and his handlers made themselves available. It wasn’t exactly free-for-all media access, but the regime was keen to display its serenity and tell its side of the story. This slight opening was perhaps to convey the message that the regime had prevailed and now had nothing to hide. In a rapid succession, Bashar gave an interview to Russia’s Channel One and two interviews to The Sunday Telegraph. Bouthaina Shaaban, one of his trusted aides and a literature professor, made herself available to The Independent. A reporter for The Washington Post was allowed into Damascus accompanied by security officers. British reporter Andrew Gilligan, who interviewed the ruler for The Sunday Telegraph, was permitted access to Hama.</p>

<p>The modernizer who spent two years in London turned up for the interviews. Andrew Gilligan was met in a modest bungalow by the ruler dressed in jeans. He was Dr. Bashar again, the policy wonk. The protests were fading, he said, their roots were not mainly political: “It’s about the whole of society, the development of society. Different problems have erupted as one crisis. We adopted liberal economics. To open your economy without preparing yourself, you open up gaps between the social strata. If you do not get the right economic model, you can’t get past the problem.” There was his heralded leadership of the Syria Computer Society, and that computer literacy was on display as well. Comparing Syria’s leadership with that of a Western country was akin to comparing a Mac to a PC. “Both computers do the same job, but they don’t understand each other. You need to translate. If you want to analyze me as the East, you cannot analyze me through the Western operating system. You have to translate according to my operating system or culture.” Told by the reporter that this was the “inner nerd” in him speaking, he laughed out loud, and the reporter was pleased that he had gotten away with the banter. The ruler was a popular man, he said of himself: “I live a normal life, we have neighbors, I take my kids to school, that’s why I am popular. It is very important to live this way—that is the Syrian style.”</p>

<p>Two days later, the same reporter was in Hama, trailed by “minders” of course. He found a “city of fear and ghosts.” There were snipers in the old Byzantine citadel positioned to fire at will into the streets, and the people the reporter encountered were on edge. They were in no mood for revelations. The governor said the city was at peace—at least 90 percent so. “The key thing we did was spreading the culture of love and cooperation with the people.” Inside the governor’s office there were screens showing closed-circuit TV pictures from around the city, “just in case any further lack of love or cooperation should occur,” the reporter added.</p>

<p>It was like this in Bashar al-Assad’s realm: the alternation of light and darkness, the regime’s Janus-like face to be shown the outside world and the fearsome crackdown. It was in that vein on November 3 that the regime would announce its acceptance of an Arab League initiative to end the fighting as 34 people were struck down by the violence. In Homs, a placard summed up the judgment of the protesters: “The Arab League and the Syrian regime, two sides of the same coin.” The rupture between the regime and the populace was given away by a deed that must have drawn inspiration from Libya, where the people discarded the green flag of Qaddafi for the flag of the monarchy: Syria’s old flag of independence was unfurled for the first time in the outskirts of Damascus. The country was seeking its second independence—and this time from the tyranny within.</p>
